x Fix display of model UI and button positions
x Remove bisimulation when models change

(maybe not a good change)
- Take into account selected worlds when bisimulation is constructed

- modelUI doesn't update when the 6th (last) proposition input has been filled in??

- Allow the user to change the grid size for models of different sizes
- Download option for the svg (or parts of it?)

- Validity checking for formulas
- Genereate models / countermodels for formulas
